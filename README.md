# Simon-game
A Simon game is a memory-based game where players must repeat a sequence of colored lights or sounds. This project implements a Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

1)Sequence Generation: The game randomly generates a sequence of colored buttons (or sounds).
2)Player Input: The player must repeat the sequence in the correct order and within a time limit.
3)Difficulty Increase: As the player progresses, the sequence becomes longer and faster, increasing the difficulty.
4)Game Over: If the player fails to correctly repeat the sequence, the game ends
